# 🅿️ Dynamic Urban Parking Price Prediction

A real-time pricing engine and visualization system for urban parking spaces based on occupancy, demand, queue length, traffic, and special events. The goal is to optimize parking prices dynamically and reroute vehicles when lots are overburdened.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project builds a **multi-model dynamic pricing system** for 14 urban parking spaces, sampled across 73 days at 18 time intervals per day. We use:

- Baseline price models using occupancy
- Demand-based dynamic pricing using multiple features
- Exponential models for smoother elasticity-based pricing
- Interactive Bokeh-based visualization of prices and competitor lots

## Workflow & Architecture
### Step 1: Data Preparation
Original dataset contains:

-Latitude/Longitude of lots

-Occupancy, QueueLength, Capacity

-VehicleType, SpecialDay, TrafficConditionNearby

-Timestamp: 04-10-2016, 07:59:00

We parse the time and normalize features as needed.

## Step 2: Model 1 – Baseline Linear Price Model
Price_{t+1} = Price_t + α * (Occupancy / Capacity)

## Step 3: Model 2 – Linear Demand-Based Price Model
Demand = α * (Occupancy / Capacity) + β * QueueLength − γ * Traffic + δ * IsSpecialDay + ε * VehicleTypeWeight
Price_t = BasePrice * (1 + λ * NormalizedDemand)

## Step 4: Model 3 – Exponential Elastic Price Model
Price = BasePrice * exp(λ * NormalizedDemand)

##Step 5: Visualization with Bokeh
Bokeh + Panel for interactive plots
